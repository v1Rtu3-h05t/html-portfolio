<h1>About Me</h1> <hr>

<body>
<p> 
Hello, my name is Anthony Morales. I am a Full Stack Programmer with a passion for creating innovative web applications.
I have experience in both front-end and back-end development, and I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to learn new skills
and technologies. Thank you for visiting my portfolio!

<h2>How My Journey Started</h2>
<p>
MySpace is where my journey started. Yes, the legendary MySpace during my high school years. I was fascinated by the ability to customize my profile and connect with friends online.
My first taste of JavaScript was the ability to add music players and interactive elements to my page. This sparked my interest in web development and 
set me on the path to becoming a Full Stack Programmer. I also quickly learned I could use JavaScript to prank my friends by adding what I now understand
to be called "Stored XSS" to my own profile. It was a fun and mischievous way to learn about the power of web technologies.
</p>

<h2>Rediscovering My Passion in Adulthood</h2>
<p>
After some time away from web development, I rediscovered my passion for coding. For years, I lived life across different jobs and industries, notably HVAC, always carrying
those early MySpace memories with me: the thrill of customizing my page, the joy of pranking friends by tweaking their layouts, and the mystery of how it all worked 
under the hood.
</p>
<p>
In 2019, I found myself dabbling in web development again, reigniting that old spark. It was around this time that I met my friend Alex in college, 
a former Army hacker with deep technical chops. One day, he overheard me reminiscing: "Man, I miss MySpace. It was so cool to decorate my page and mess with my friends' profiles."
</p>
<p>
He smiled and broke it down for me. What I thought was just playful customization was actually my first encounter with real-world web exploitation, stored XSS. Alex guided
me back into the world of coding, helping me understand the intricacies of web security and development. With his mentorship, I dove deep into learning Python, Linux 
and having fun with front-end projects again.
</p>
<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>
My goals moving forward are simple but powerful: gain hands-on experience, continue expanding my skill set, and connect with others who share my passion for technology and 
coding. I am open to opportunities, especially with companies that value creativity, and the kind of passion I bring to every project. Working with a team that understands 
and appreciates my drive would be an incredible blessing. I truly love what I do so I am confident I would become an asset to any organization.
